# Train Scheduler (Firebase)

The train application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app will retrieve and manipulate the information with Moment.js. 

This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Users will be able to submit the following:

Train Name
Destination
First Train Time - in military time
Frequency - in minutes

The app will figure out when the next train will arrive relative to the current time.
